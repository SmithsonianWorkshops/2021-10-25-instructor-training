<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->

<p>
  The course is aimed at everyone who is
  interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular, this training
  is aimed at those who want to become <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a>,
  <a href="{{ site.lc_site }}">Library Carpentry</a>, and <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a>
  Instructors, run workshops and contribute to The Carpentries training
  materials. You don't currently have to be an instructor or a
  teacher to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and
  committed to becoming one and to improving your teaching techniques.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a>, <a href="{{ site.lc_site }}">Library Carpentry</a>, and 
  <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission is to
  help scientists, researchers, and librarians get more research done in less time
  and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific
  computing.  This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of
  educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to
  use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes.
</p>
<p>
  The workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you
  practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and
  implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss.
  This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not
  need any particular technical background, and we will not be
  teaching that. This workshop is based on the constantly revised and
  updated
 <a href="{{ site.training_site }}">curriculum</a>.
</p>

<h4>{{ loc.venue }}</h4>

{% if online == "online" %}

This is an online event. We will meet using the online videoconference software Zoom. You will need to <a href="https://zoom.us/download">download and install their client</a> to connect with your instructors. The link to use for this event will be delivered to registrants via email approximately one week before the start of your scheduled training.

<h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>

We are committed to making this workshop
accessible to everybody.
The workshop organisers have checked that:

<ul>
  <li>The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.</li>
  <li>Accessible restrooms are available.</li>
</ul>

Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop and
large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the
organizers in advance.  If we can help making learning easier for
you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please
please get in touch (using contact details below) and we will
attempt to provide them.

{% endif %}

<h3>Requirements</h3>

Participants should bring a laptop that is Internet connected and has a
functioning browser. If you have it, a device for recording audio and video
(mobile phones and laptops are OK) is useful as throughout the two days, we
are going to record one another teaching in pairs or threes. It does not have
to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what
someone is saying.

Please note that after this course is over, you will be asked to do
three short follow-up exercises online in order to finish qualifying
as an instructor: the details are available at
<a href="{{ site.training_site }}/checkout/">{{ site.training_site }}/checkout/</a>.
If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material,
or anything else, please get in touch.


<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

All participants are required to abide by The Carpentries <a href="{{
